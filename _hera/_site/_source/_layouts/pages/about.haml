      Hera is a mashup of several static website development frameworks and utilities. These include Jekyll, Haml, and Sass. All of these tools can be researched and installed separately, but Hera will install and get you going very quick. Jekyll doesnâ€™t support Haml or Sass by default, which is the main drive behind Hera. Hera will not only install Jekyll, Haml and Sass, but also provide you with a simple site directory with watchers and conversions.
