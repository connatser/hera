h2. Typical workflow

# @gem install hera@
# @cd@ to where you want to install the core structure, typically an empty directory.
# @hera --init@ to install the core structure.
# @hera --watch@ to start watching and auto-compiling your source.
# Within @_source/_layouts@ you can edit the templates:
    ## @/haml@ contains the main Jekyll layout templates.
    ## @/pages@ contains the site pages.
    ## @/posts@ contains the site posts.
    ## @/sass@ contains the site css templates
# Once you are ready to deploy:
    ## @CTRL+C@ to stop watching Hera"
    ## @hera --generate@ to build the jekyll site.
    ## @CTRL+C@ to stop Jekyll once you are ready to minimize.
    ## @hera --minimize@ to minimize the css and js assets prior to deploying.
       ### currently there is a bug that causes you to edit the _css_jammit.yml and _js_jammit.yml files before the minimizer will work.
    ## @hera --deploy@ to deploy your site, via rsync/ssh.
        ### Please make sure to update your credentials in the top of @/RakeFile@
# Send me feedback, critiques, cake, and most importantly: fork and contribute.
