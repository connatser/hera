h2. What is Hera?

"Hera":http://connatser.github.com/hera/, from HydraulicLabs, is an elegant and easy to use static web site architecture. Implementing Jekyll, Haml, Sass, & Jammit to bring a static website to life fast. Hera was developed to reduce setup time, promote clean code, and instantly set up the typical dependencies when working with popular web frameworks.

h2. How to use Hera.

Install the gem:
  @gem install hera@ - the hera gem is hosted on "rubygems.org/gems/hera":https://rubygems.org/gems/hera
  
Initialize hera
  @hera --init@ - Clones a copy of a base Hera structure for you to begin working your magic.
  
Start watching hera
  @hera --watch@ - Starts watching your haml and sass directories, automatically compiling them.

Minimize your assets
  @hera --minimize@ - Runs Jammit to minimize your css and js scripts. - add any new css/js to _css_jammit.yml & _js_jammit.yml.

Generates the hera site
  @hera --generate@ - Generates your Jekyll site and starts a preview at "http://localhost:4000":http://localhost:4000
    
Deploy hera
  @hera --deploy@ - Auto-uploads your site for you. - make sure to update ssh_user and remote_root in the site's RakeFile

h2. Typical workflow

# @gem install hera@
# @cd@ to where you want to install the core structure, typically an empty directory.
# @hera --init@ to install the core structure.
# @hera --watch@ to start watching and auto-compiling your source.
# Within @_source/_layouts@ you can edit the templates:
    ## @/haml@ contains the main Jekyll layout templates.
    ## @/pages@ contains the site pages.
    ## @/posts@ contains the site posts.
    ## @/sass@ contains the site css templates
# Once you are ready to deploy:
    ## @CTRL+C@ to stop watching Hera"
    ## @hera --generate@ to build the jekyll site.
    ## @CTRL+C@ to stop Jekyll once you are ready to minimize.
    ## @hera --minimize@ to minimize the css and js assets prior to deploying.
       ### currently there is a bug that causes you to edit the _css_jammit.yml and _js_jammit.yml files before the minimizer will work.
    ## @hera --deploy@ to deploy your site, via rsync/ssh.
        ### Please make sure to update your credentials in the top of @/RakeFile@
# Send me feedback, critiques, cake, and most importantly: fork and contribute.
